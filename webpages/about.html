 <center><h3>About</h3></center>

 <center>###</center>
 <br>
 <p>
 	I am Muchukota Shiva (wow big first name). People call me whatever they want so you can too. Some common nicknames for me are shiv, chibby, muchu, monkey, monk, punk monk, skeleton and some more i forgor.
So yeah I am a very nice guy first off :D and I am not like other people.
 I tend to think quite differently from the general crowd which yes sounds extremely weird for a normal member of human civilization but trust me I fit into almost every group of people.
  The way I think differently is just me vs my own demons.
 </p>
 <p>
 	I follow a few sayings in life. the first and foremost being "treat others the way you want them to treat you".
 	I kept doing this for a long time and now this is just a part of my general personality. I might seem a bit too nice or something so people think I am weird or am expecting something out of them. Cant help it bucko I am just too nice for my own good.
 </p>
 <br>

 <br>
 <p>
 	So about my general personality.
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I appear as a quiet man of few words who only talks what is required at first. That is because I am like a bud. I open up to only those people who i feel are worth opening up to or those who i feel comfortable around. Bravo if I have opened up to you ;)
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I consider everyone to be my friend, that is just my nature. All that depends is how the other person perceives me. If I do not feel the same affection/warmth from them I tend to not open up to them. They just stay friends, however those who see me for who I am not just ask me for notes or just like call me when they have work, they see the real and nice me.
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I am a very humorous guy. I am sarcastic, witty and dank.
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> My MBTI is XNFP meaning I possess traits of both INFPs and ENFPs (Introverted/Extroverted iNtuitive Feeling Prospecting) or simply I am a mix of mediator/peacemaker and campaigner/encourager. I am a very peaceful and calm guy, but I do not shy away from mischief cuz i am quite a naughty guy ;) 
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I am a stoic. I follow stoicism. Well as much as I can. Currently working on being anti-fragile(a very interesting concept look it up)
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I am a person who is super empathetic and if not overly super optimistic. I am a also a cool person in the sense that I stay calm under pressure or at least that's what It looks like. I am a very happy person too. I go through my sad boy hours but Those come to an end too. If you ever feeling down, a chat with me will 90% make you feel better. In general just talking to me will make anyone feel better(yes i am introverted but i like talking to people)
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> Sometimes I seem like a super intelligent guy who will probably do very well in life blah blah but then a few your later you might see me go full retard sicko mode and say is "Is bande ka kya hoga". This cuz my IQ is like a sin wave. I have my highs and lows. Generally when i am in class i am on the upper side and when i am with friends I am on the lower side. perfectly balanced as all things should be.
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> I was quite an immature fellow till my 8th grade or so but then god knows what happened maybe got felt some pity and did something I suddenly matured. This is one of the reasons I have a really strong moral compass and why I believe a lot in discipline. Dont worry this wont make me a boring person
 </p>
 <p>
 	-> Despite trying to be perfect all sorts of bizarre things happen to me. I am quite an accident prone person lol. I am clumsy and the most weird stuff happens to me. If my life could be a movie/series I would call it Muchu's bizarre misadventures.
 </p>

 <p>
 	I am a bit above the average joe when it comes to academics but still am quite good at it. Am okay-okay in sports too, my favorite being general long distance running and basketball.
 </p>
 <p>
 	I have a different taste in media compared to most people because I got exposed to anime and manga at a young age. This along with my innate love for computers and gaming made me steer away from bollywood and the mainstream stuff most people watch. Because of this I developed a rather niche taste in things, which inturn made me feel a bit alienated in groups as I cant relate to what most people are talking about but hey its a small world you will always find a person or two who you can relate to and that is good enough for me.
 </p>
 <p>
 	This also affected(in a good way) my sense of humor as I shifted towards ironic humor and whatnot which most people dont understand. In this process I managed to get over the general "this guy normie" attitude. I killed the part of me that cringes. I started to accept that different people have different opinions. Respecting these opinions not only put me at peace but helped avoid opinion wars which is great. So yeah I am now a part of all sorts of humor.
 </p>
 <p>
 	Any hobbies? Wasting time, thinking about and doing useless stuff(for example me sitting and typing this at 11:30 pm), imagining scenarios in my head. Seriously I am not sure what i am good at. I guess you can say my hobbies are video game, reading manga/watching anime, reading novels, consuming romantic media(not the love vala romantic) and going out for runs. last but not the least talking to people :)
 </p>
